# Gameplay

## Entities

### Unicorn

A unicorn is an mystical animal that roams your ranch, it can be either a baby, kid, teenager or an adult. These are the stages of a unicorn. 

Each unicorn has a happiness counter, this can be influenced by a few game aspects:
- Feeding the preferred food.
- Petting them.
- Cleaning them?

A unicorn goes to the next stage when they have eaten enough.

### Food

Food is what a player uses to feed their unicorns. Each stage of unicorn has a preferred type of food, feeding them the correct food will ensure they grow up. Feeding the incorrect food will make them mad. 

TODO: describe other items that show overtime?

## Game values

The game starts with an empty ranch, two baby unicorns have just appeared in the players ranch and it is now their sole responsibility to keep the unicorns happy. The player is now a unicorn parent.
- **VALUE**: This adds RESPONSIBILITY, giving the player a purpose.

Feeding unicorns will ensure they "grow" through their stages. 
- **VALUE**: This adds PROGRESSION, keeping the player feel that they still are having an impact.

The better the player take care of the unicorns the happier they are and they will tell their lovely friends that the player is a nice person. Therefore more unicorns will show themselves overtime.
- **VALUE**: This adds SATISFACTION, strengthens the purpose and progression feeling of a player.

If the player forgets to feed the unicorns, because they didn't open the app to feed the unicorns, or make them mad they will leave the player's ranch.
- **VALUE**: This adds GUILT, makes players come back to the game to ensure their progression.

## Measure scoring

Scoring is based on the total happiness of all the unicorns in the ranch multiplied by a multiplier from the stage they are in.

## Controls

### Feeding

Feeding a unicorn their preferred food will add to their grow value, once they have reached the threshold of their current stage they will evolve into the next stage. Feeding a unicorn is done by dragging food to the unicorn.

### Petting

A player can pet a unicorn to make it feel appreciated, this will increase it's happiness and therefore it will stay on the ranch. Each unicorn can be petted separately and it will reset after an X amount of time after the last pet on that unicorn.
